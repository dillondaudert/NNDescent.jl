A Julia implementation of Nearest Neighbor Descent.

> Dong, Wei *et al.* Efficient K-Nearest Neighbor Graph Construction for Generic Similarity Measures. *WWW* (2011).

## Overview

Nearest Neighbor Descent (NNDescent) is an approximate K-nearest neighbor graph construction algorithm that has
several useful properties:
- **general**: works with arbitrary dissimilarity functions
- **scalable**: has an empirical complexity of O(n^1.14) pairwise comparisons for a dataset of size n
- **space efficient**: the only data structure required is an approximate KNN graph which is operated on in-place and is also the final output
- **accurate**: converges to above 90% recall while only comparing each data point to a small percentage of the whole dataset on average

NNDescent is based on the heuristic argument that *a neighbor of a neighbor is also likely to be a neighbor*. That is,
given a list of approximate nearest neighbors to a point, we can improve that list by exploring the neighbors of each
point in the list. The algorithm is in essence the repeated application of this principle.


## Usage
The `DescentGraph` constructor builds the approximate kNN graph:
```jl
DescentGraph(data, n_neighbors, metric; max_iters, sample_rate, precision)
```
- `data`: The set of points to build the tree from. This must be of type
`Vector{V}`, where `V <: AbstractVector` **or** `AbstractMatrix`.
- `n_neighbors`: An integer specifies the number of neighbors to find
- `metric`: Any metric `M` where `M <: SemiMetric` from the Distances.jl package. Default is `Euclidean()`.

The performance of NN Descent can be tuned with several keyword arguments.
- `max_iters`: This controls the maximum number of iterations to search for
neighbors. Default is `10`.
- `sample_rate`: The algorithm performs a local join around the candidate
neighbors of each point during execution. The sample rate is the likelihood
that each candidate be included in the local join for an iteration. Default is
`1.`.
- `precision`: This argument roughly corresponds to the fraction of true
nearest neighbors that will be missed by the algorithm. Default `.001`.

The k-nearest neighbors can be accessed through the `indices` and `distances`
attributes. These are both `KxN` matrices containing ids and distances to each
point's neighbors, respectively, where `K = n_neighbors` and `N = length(data)`.

Example:
```jl
using NearestNeighborDescent
data = [rand(10) for _ in 1:1000]
# OR data = rand(10, 1000)
n_neighbors = 5

# nn descent search
graph = DescentGraph(data, n_neighbors)

# access point i's jth nearest neighbor:
graph.indices[j, i]
graph.distances[j, i]
```

Once constructed, the `DescentGraph` can be used to find the nearest
neighbors to new points. This is done via the `search` method:
```jl
search(graph, queries, n_neighbors, queue_size) -> indices, distances
```
- `graph`: An instance of `DescentGraph`
- `queries`: A vector of new data points of type `Vector{V}` or `AbstractMatrix`.
Note that the dimensionality of the queries should match that of the data used to
originally construct the graph.
- `n_neighbors`: The number of neighbors to find for each query. This does
*not* have to be the same as the number used to construct `graph`.
- `queue_size`: Each query maintains a heap of candidate neighbors.
`queue_size` controls the maximum number of candidates as a multiple of
`n_neighbors`. Default is `1.`.

Similar to `DescentGraph`, this returns two matrices for the indices and
distances to the nearest neighbors of each query.

Example:
```jl
queries = [rand(10) for _ in 1:100]
# OR queries = rand(10, 100)
idxs, dists = search(knngraph, queries, 4)
```
