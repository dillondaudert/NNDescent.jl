"""
    nndescent(data, n_neighbors, metric)

Find the approximate neighbors of each point in `data` by  iteratively
refining a KNN graph of type `graph_type`. Returns the final KNN graph.

# Arguments
- `max_iters = 10`: Limits the number of iterations to refine candidate
nearest neighbors. Higher values trade off speed for accuracy. Note that graph
construction may terminate early if little progress is being made.
- `sample_rate = 1`: The sample rate for calculating *local joins*
around each point. Lower values trade off accuracy for speed.
- `precision = 1e-3`: The threshold for early termination,
where precision is "roughly the fraction of true kNN allowed to be missed due to
early termination". Lower values take longer but return more accurate results.

"""
    local_join!(g::HeapKNNGraph, data, metric::PreMetric; kwargs...)

Perform a local join on each vertex `v`'s neighborhood `N[v]` in `g`. Given vertex `v`
and its neighbors `N[v]`, compute the similar `metric(p, q)` for each pair `p, q ∈ N[v]` and
update `N[q]` and `N[p]`.

This mutates `g` in-place and returns a nonnegative integer indicating how many neighbor
updates took place during the local join.
